## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### What I learned

In building this webpage, I gained foundational knowledge in HTML, establishing the structure of the site and incorporating engaging SVG graphics for an eye-catching header. The addition of CSS allowed me to aesthetically enhance the webpage by choosing fonts, colors, and designing an accordion-style FAQ section, where questions reveal their answers upon clicking. JavaScript was employed to introduce interactivity, enabling the transformation of a plus icon to a minus icon upon clicking a question. By listening for user clicks, JavaScript responded dynamically, providing a seamless and engaging user experience. Ensuring responsiveness across various devices was achieved through media queries, adjusting the layout for optimal viewing. Organizing the code into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files facilitated clarity and maintainability. Additionally, the utilization of external files for CSS and JavaScript exemplified a modular and tidy approach to development. This project served as a valuable exercise in combining these web technologies to create a functional and visually appealing webpage.
